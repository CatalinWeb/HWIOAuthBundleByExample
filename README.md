This is a [HWIOAuthBundle](https://github.com/hwi/HWIOAuthBundle) working example with automatic user registration in the database.

These are some files that will get you up and running with the login system for Facebook, Google, Live and Twitter. You can add as many as you'd like since you only have to make a few changes.

After you register your applications on the social networks, put their details in parameters.yml and start playing with it.
